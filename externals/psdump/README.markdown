## Introduction

**psdump** is a command line utility which parses Photoshop files and
outputs their layer hierarchy as a text, JSON, or XML data. Position and
size of each layer are included in the output.

The program has been tested on the following systems:

* Mac OS X
* Windows XP, 7
* Linux (Ubuntu 9.10)

## Known issues

When used on Mac OS X with a Photoshop file slightly larger than the
most basic one, **psdump** crashes with `Segmentation fault`. The reason
of the crash is supposedly a bug in the **libpsd**. Further
investigation is planned for an unknown moment in the indefinite future.

## Installing psdump

In order to start using **psdump** you will likely need to build it
from source. However, there are precompiled binaries for Mac OS X and
Windows family. They can be found on the [Downloads][downloads] page.

Once you've downloaded a binary release for your OS, unzip it and type
`psdump --help` in the terminal window.

## Building from source

### The UNIX way

Building from source is fairly simple on a *UNIX-like* system. You just
need to run `make` in the terminal window. The binary will appear in a
newly created 'build' directory. _(If you are running some kind of
minimalistic Linux distribution, you may need to additionally install
g++.)_

You can also run `make test` to run the test-suite and `make tidyup` to
remove intermediate object files. _(If you don't have python
installed, run `make shtest` instead of `make test`.)_

### Instructions for Windows users

To build from source on *Windows* there are several options.

The first one is to use [MinGW][mingw] with [MSYS][msys]. With those
tools installed, building is as easy as typing `mingw32-make` (or a
similar command) in the MSYS terminal window.

Another way to build **psdump** is using [Cygwin][cygwin]. With 'g++'
and 'make' packages installed, you just need to run `make` in the
Cygwin-bash.
>_**Important notice**. If you build psdump using Cygwin, it won't work
without cygwin1.dll._

Lastly, a Microsoft compiler can be used to build from source. You will
find a Visual Studio project file in the 'vcproj' directory. This file
has been created in MS Visual Studio 2005 (version 9).

## Dependencies

To parse Photoshop files, **libpsd** is used. You don't need to download
it separately since its source code is already included with **psdump** and
it hasn't changed since, I guess, 2007. You may visit its project page
on [SourceForge.net][libpsd].

Apart from **libpsd**, there are no other requirements to be able to
successfully build **psdump** from source.

## Roadmap

Feedback, feature requests, and code reviews are most welcome! Please
let me know about your experience using **psdump**.

It has been designed in such a way that makes it easy to add more output
formats and even to parse other hierarchical files, not just Photoshop
ones.

The following improvements are expected to be introduced in the future:

* provide more detailed documentation on adding new features
* check for conformance of JSON and XML outputs to their corresponding
specifications
* tweak the program architecture to make it easy to handle multiple
document outputs into a single file in a polymorphic way
* write unit-tests and create a more elaborate test-suite
* build and test on as many platforms as possible (your help will be
appreciated)

Once the above features are implemented, version 1.0 will be released.
