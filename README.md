# TOW

TOW is a tiny OpenGL wrapper written in Literate. The Literate code of TOW is not much different from C++, so you can read them without any knowledge about Literate. TOW only encapsulates the primary functions of OpenGL but provides more convenient methods with safety and less overhead.ðŸš€

To draw something on the screen, in most cases, you only need two objects:  `Framebuffer` and  `Graphicpipeline`, you can see the code below for detail.

```C++
// draw a simple triangle
tow::FramebufferPtr fb;
tow::GraphicPipelinePtr pipeline;

void init(){
    using namespace tow;
    
    fb = Framebuffer::create();
    
    vec2 vertices[] = { {-1, -1}, {1, -1}, {0, 1} };
    auto layout = VertexLayout::create();
    layout->add("a_position", {GL_FLOAT, 2});
    layout->stride(sizeof(vec2));
    
    auto bufGroup = BufferGroup::create();
    bufGroup->createBuffer("b_vertex", vertices, {GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vec2), 3});
    
    pipeline = GraphicPipeline::create({bufGroup, "b_vertex"}, layout);
}

void render(float x, float y, float w, float h){    
    fb->bind(x, y, w, h);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
    tow::drawArrays(pipeline, GL_TRIANGLES);
}
```

## How to compile

On Windows, make sure you have installed vs2017 or later before running premake5.bat.
On other platforms, you should download your platform corresponding premake5 and make, then type in:

```C++
make -C lit all
premak5 your_action
```

(you can go to [here](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Using-Premake) to see what action you can choose)

## Examples

### glTF Model Viewer

A viewer that can load gltf/glb file, and supports PBR, skin, morph target, and animation. If you want to know what is glTF, you can see [here](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/README.md). Most gltf/glb files I have tested are from [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models?features=downloadable&sort_by=-likeCount) and [GeneratedAssets](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Asset-Generator), however, in order to keep this repository size small, I don't put all of them into the assets folder.

### Shader Toy

A simple [shader toy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) simulator that you can write glsl code to implement cool graphic effects.

### UI Editor

An editor that is used to edit game UI elements. If you have a [PSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop#File_format) file that all UI elements have been arranged, drop it into the editor, so you can edit again or save as a JSON file directly.
